            If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social
            media account, we may have access to certain information about you.
            <br id="6"></br>
            Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your
            third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or
            Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive
            certain profile information about you from your social media
            provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on
            the social media provider concerned, but will often include your
            name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as
            other information you choose to make public on such a social media
            platform.
            <br></br>
            We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that
            are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made
            clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not
            control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal
            information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend
            that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect,
            use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your
            privacy preferences on their sites and apps.

            purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required
            by law.
            <br id="7"></br>
            We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
            necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
            longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as
            tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this
            notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer
            than the period of time in which users have an account with us.
            <br></br>
            When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
            personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
            information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
            personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we
            will securely store your personal information and isolate it from
            any further processing until deletion is possible.

            We aim to protect your personal information through a system of
            organizational and technical security measures.
            <br id="8"></br>
            We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
            organizational security measures designed to protect the security of
            any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards
            and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission
            over the Internet or information storage technology can be
            guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that
            hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will
            not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access,
            steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to
            protect your personal information, transmission of personal
            information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should
            only access the Services within a secure environment.

            </div>
            Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
            applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you
            can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
            about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At
            this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
            implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not
            currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
            automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If
            a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the
            future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version
            of this privacy notice.
